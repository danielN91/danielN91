## 🔎 About me
As a dedicated and meticulous QA Tester with a passion for **ensuring software quality**, I have compiled this portfolio to **highlight my achievements**, projects, and expertise in various testing methodologies. This portfolio demonstrates my ability to identify and report bugs effectively, create comprehensive test cases, and contribute to automation efforts.
This portfolio includes both **my work projects** and **my freelance projects** dating back to 2019.

I have been actively engaged in Manual testing tasks since 2015, but my commitment to testing intensified in 2019 when I began freelancing on various platforms. As a Freelancer, I delivered manual testing services to multiple clients across different projects and platforms. In 2023, I embarked on my journey with test automation, and in May 2023, I successfully developed and executed my first automated test scripts using Selenium.
